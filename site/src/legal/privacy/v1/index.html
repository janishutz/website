					What data is collected on you?
					<p class="info">This website and all of my services do not collect any data on how you interact with them. All data that is collected on you is data you willingly and at your own responsibility provide me with when signing up or using any of my services. Whilst I try to have everything run cloud-less, some features still require some data handling on my servers.</p>
				</li></b>
				<b><li>
					How is this data stored and processed?
					<p class="info">All the data that has to be sent to the cloud for processing, like the contact form, is sent to my servers using an HTTPS connection, hence, it is an encrypted connection. The data from the contact from is then sent to one of my email addresses via my mail server and is never stored on the actual server. You may have your request deleted at any time. To do so, please contact me again or respond to my response email.</p>
				</li></b>
				<b><li>
					How can I have my data deleted?
					<p class="info">To have your data deleted, please <a href="/support/contact">contact me</a>.</p>
				</li></b>
				<b><li>
					Cookies
					<p class="info">Most of my websites do not use any cookies. If they do use cookies, the specific service will explicitly state so when you first visit the page. Cookies are small amounts of text-based data which is used to identify you, which, whenever one of my services uses cookies, is required to allow you to for example sign into that page. No third party cookies are used on any of my websites</p>
				</li></b>
				<b><li>
					Sharing data with third parties
					<p class="info">No data is shared with any third parties, except I have your explicit, written permission to do so in case I need to forward your query to somebody else.</p>
				</li></b>
				<b><li>
					Updating this privacy Policy
					<p class="info">I retain the right to, at any time, at my own will and discretion to update this privacy policy. Valid is always the privacy policy which is available at this URL</p>
