				<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 5%;">Managing storage can be a challenging task, especially, when the volume of items stored gets big. If products in that storage can go bad, you are very likely to produce quite a bit of waste. StorageManager is an iOS app that can send you notifications such that you do not forget about products that are about to expire.</p>
				<div class="sidebyside">
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Notifications.</h3>
						<p>StorageManager can send you notifications when a product is about to expire so you don't forget about the product. Notifications time can be customised in settings.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'notifications' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Adding products.</h3>
						<p>You can add products by simply scanning the product's barcode and adding some data on the product. The app will remember the product such that the next time you scan it, it will autofill all relevant data.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'adding' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sidebyside">
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Editing products.</h3>
						<p>Products can be edited straight from the products details page. You can edit every aspect of the product data to the extent that you can make it an entirely different kind.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'editing' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Removing products.</h3>
						<p>You can remove products by simply swiping to delete. Alternatively you can delete products by hitting the delete icon in the details page or even better, by scanning the product's barcode.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'removing' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sidebyside">
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Organisation.</h3>
						<p>StorageManager allows you to create product categories and one storage location. If you purchase the full version, you can add an infinite amount of storage locations. The In-App-Purchase is sharable with up to five people in your family.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'organising' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Filtering & sorting.</h3>
						<p>You can sort and filter all the data. Many different sorting options and filters are available, as well as a powerful search function, that finds all your products within milliseconds.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'filter' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sidebyside">
					<div class="element">
						<h3>iCloud-Sync.</h3>
						<p>StorageManager has iCloud-Sync built in and enabled for ALL users. Simply allow iCloud access for StorageManager and you are off to the races. Your storage data syncs magically between all your Apple-Devices.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'icloud' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Free.*</h3>
						<p>You can use StorageManager for free, with one small exception being adding an unlimited amount of storage locations. For this you will need to make an In-App-Purchase. Please check the AppStore for the exact pricing as this is dependent on your country.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'free' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="sidebyside">
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Easy setup.</h3>
						<p>StorageManager features an easy to use, guided setup such that you can be up and running within just one or two minutes of downloading the app.</p>
						<button class="button" onclick="openDetails( 'setup' )">Learn more</button>
					</div>
					<div class="element">
						<h3>Display settings.</h3>
						<p>Choose what is displayed on the main page of the app with simple toggles in the app's settings page. This allows you to see everything you want at a glance or have more items on the screen at once.</p>

					'notification': '<h3>Notifications.</h3><p>This app can send you notifications. For this you will need to enable notifications for the app in the iOS settings or accept notifications when the app asks you, if it can send notifications during setup.</p>',
					'adding': '<h3>Adding products.</h3><p>You can add new products with two options. Either, if the product has a Barcode, you can use the built-in barcode scanner to scan it or by manually entering the product details. If a product has been added before, StorageManager will autofill the information necessary when scanning the barcode or when selecting a suggestion it gives you when typing the product name.</p>',
					'editing': '<h3>Editing products.</h3><p>You can edit every aspect of every product you have ever added. StorageManager will also allow you to use changed data as new defaults for this kind of product.</p>',
					'removing': `<h3>Removing products.</h3><p>You have three different options for removing products. First off, you can remove it by scanning the product's barcode and then selecting the product you want to delete. The other two options are to swipe to delete the product on the app's home page and to tap the delete button in the product's details page.</p>`,
					'organising': '<h3>Organising products.</h3><p>StorageManager allows you to create an infinite number of categories which you can use to organise your products. For all full-version users, it also features an unlimited amount of storage locations.</p>',
					'filter': '<h3>Filtering, Sorting & Searching.</h3><p>StorageManager features powerful filtering, sorting and searching tools. You can sort your products by all kinds of aspects including, but not limited to, name, add date and expiry date. You can also filter products based on which category they belong to and what location they are in.</p>',
					'icloud': '<h3>iCloud-Sync.</h3><p>StorageManager offers ALL its users to use iCloud-Sync. You need to have iCloud enabled for StorageManager for this feature to work. Please turn the feature on in system settings, if you want to use iCloud-Sync. The data will then magically sync between all your Apple devices.</p>',
					'free': '<h3>Free.*</h3><p>StorageManager is technically free to use, if you are fine with just one storage location. Otherwise, you will need to make an In-App-Purchase of roughly two US-Dollars to unlock the full version which gives you access to an unlimited amount of locations.</p>',
					'setup': '<h3>Easy setup.</h3><p>StorageManager has a very convenient onboarding, or in other words, setup process. It helps you create your first category and a storage location. It will also now ask you for all the permissions it will need, which it also explains, why it needs them.</p>',
					'display': '<h3>Display settings.</h3><p>In the display settings of the app, you can choose what is displayed on the home screen and therefore decide if you want to see as many as possible products or rather as many information as possible on each of the products.</p>'
