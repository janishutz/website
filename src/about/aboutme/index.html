				<p>My name is Janis Hutz, I am 19 years old and am learning to code in many different programming languages. By now I am quite fluent in a couple of programming languages, including Swift & SwiftUI (Apple's programming languages); Python (with three different Graphical User Interface Toolkits (Kivy (and KivyMD), PyQT5 and PyGTK)); JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML and CSS. You may find my iOS Apps on the AppStore and most of my other projects as Free & Open Source Software over on GitHub. Usually, when I OpenSource a project, I tend to use the GNU General Public License V3.0 (GPL V3), as this allows you (if you are a FOSS-dev) to do the most with this code whilst not helping out big companies like Google, Micro$oft, etc.</p>
				<p>I spend most of my freetime coding, as this is what I enjoy the most, other than that I am a passionate Archlinux user, so I spend occasionally some time troubleshooting something. Therefore I am not a big fan of Micro$oft, Google or Meta, but I quite adore the work that Apple does, surprisingly.</p>
				<p>As I am still in my studies, my time to code is limited to what I can do outside of school, and sadly I cannot yet go to University, as I am too young and I haven't finished secondary school yet.</p>
