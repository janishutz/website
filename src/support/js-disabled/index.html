				<p>First off all, I want to apologize for any inconvenience that arose due to the website's reliance on JavaScript.</p>
				<p>JavaScript is essential to over 99% of the website's correct functioning. Some of my websites rely especially heavily on JavaScript as they are so-called web apps or have other essential features provided by JavaScript.</p>
                <p>There are multiple ways to enable JavaScript, each depending on your specific configuration. Most commonly, JavaScript was disabled in the web browser settings. Open your browser's settings and search for JavaScript and make sure that it is turned on.</p>
                <p>Other common ways in which JavaScript is disabled is with browser extensions. You will either have a small icon for the extension in your browser's toolbar or in the browser's extensions menu. Make sure you have no extension like "NoScript" enabled on your browser. If so, please add an exception for the website on which you get the JavaScript disabled notice.</p>
