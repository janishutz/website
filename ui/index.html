					<h3>PC Building</h3>
					<p>Are you looking for a new gaming or work PC that is perfectly fitted for your needs and has an upgrade path in the future and you live in Switzerland? Here you can get your new, fully customised PC!</p>

					<h3>Custom Websites</h3>
					<p>Websites generally perform very well in Google searches when built from scratch using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. That's exactly what I do. Need more than just a static website with a blog and some contact forms? Depending on what it is, I might not be able to do it for you.</p>

					<h3>Open Source Software</h3>
					<p>As a huge Open Source fan, I also developed some software whose code you can freely use, if your project uses the GPL V3 License. I am also contributing to a JavaScript presentation framework called <a href="https://impress.js.org" class="textlink" style="color: darkblue">impress.js</a></p>
